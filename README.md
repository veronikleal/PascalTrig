Pascal's Triangle

Implement a program to recursively print out Pascal's Triangle:

 1: 1 
 2: 1 1 
 3: 1 2 1 
 4: 1 3 3 1 
 5: 1 4 6 4 1 
 6: 1 5 10 10 5 1 
 7: 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 
 8: 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1 
 9: 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 
10: 1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1 
        
Important questions to ask yourself:

What is the base case?
What is the recursive case?
What should the method return?
Your class should be called Pascal and have one static
method called triangle that takes an argument 'n' and
returns the n-th line of Pascal's Triangle.

Here is the code  Download codefor the main method that
will call the method you write.
